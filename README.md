#### Why REngine - Atomic ?

This project is a fork of Atomic Game Engine that is abandoned 
This is a very cool project and can be my sucessor of my personal game engine called REngine.

### Credits
Huge thanks to the dedicated team behind Urho3D and Thunderbeast for crafting this incredible source code. It's truly disheartening to see it reach its conclusion, and to conclude in this manner. But your exceptional work will never be forgotten.
